## Errors in GS1 element string data

Parsing and validation errors of GLNs, GTINs, and SSCCs nested inside GS1
element strings no longer raises [`ParseError`][biip.ParseError]. Instead, the
exception message is exposed on the
[`GS1ElementString`][biip.gs1_element_strings.GS1ElementString] class as the new
fields `gln_error`, `gtin_error`, and `sscc_error`.

This is a breaking change, but makes it possible to extract some information
from GS1 Element Strings that are not entirely valid.
(Fixes: #157, PR: #169)

## Removed APIs

- Removed `RcnRegion.from_iso_3166_1_numeric_code()` method which as been
  deprecated since Biip 2.2.
