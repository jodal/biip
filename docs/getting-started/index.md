# Getting started

The following guide and examples should get you started with parsing barcode
data using Biip.

Throughout the examples, we'll use [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/) for
pretty-printing the results. This is entirely optional, but it makes the output
more readable. The examples are complete, so you can copy and paste them into
your own Python shell to follow along.

```python
>>> from rich import print
>>> import biip
```

See the [Reference](../reference/biip.md) for details on the API and data fields
used in the examples on the following pages.
