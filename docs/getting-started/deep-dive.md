# Deep dive

This guide covered the surface of Biip and should get you quickly up and
running.

If you need to dive deeper, all parts of Biip have extensive docstrings
with references to the relevant parts of specifications from GS1 and
ISO. As a last resource, you have the code as well as a test suite with
100% code coverage.

Happy barcode scanning!
